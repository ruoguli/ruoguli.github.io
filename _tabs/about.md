Ruogu Li is grateful for the encouragement from Ms. Zhang.


Recently:
1. The difference in the taste of Coca-Cola from different origins🥤.
2. Classical music and piano 🎹.

**Steven Weinberg (1933-2021)**
1. But I did learn one big thing: that no one knows everything, and you don’t have to.
2. Another lesson to be learned, to continue using my oceanographic metaphor, is that while you are swimming and not sinking you should aim for rough water.
3. My third piece of advice is probably the hardest to take. It is to forgive yourself for wasting time.
4. Finally, learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own branch of science.
