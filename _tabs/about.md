**Steven Weinberg (1933-2021)**
1. But I did learn one big thing: that no one knows everything, and you don’t have to./没有人知晓一切，你也不必如此。
2. Another lesson to be learned, to continue using my oceanographic metaphor, is that while you are swimming and not sinking you should aim for rough water./去到人少的地方，那里满是机遇。
3. My third piece of advice is probably the hardest to take. It is to forgive yourself for wasting time./原谅自己浪费时间。
4. Finally, learn something about the history of science, or at a minimum the history of your own branch of science./读一些科学史。

**Arthur Schopenhauer (1788-1860)**
